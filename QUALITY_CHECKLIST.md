# IMMUTABLE LESSON QUALITY CHECKLIST

## DO NOT SKIP THESE STEPS. DO NOT ACCEPT SHORTCUTS.

---

## BEFORE YOU START EDITING: REFERENCE COMPARISON
Read Lesson 01 (Communication Mastery) Exercise 1 section FIRST.
This is your quality baseline. Your lesson must feel like THIS when done.
- [x] Read Lesson 01 Exercise 1 completely
- [x] Understand the teaching voice
- [x] Notice: narrative, specificity, examples, guidance

---

## STEP 1: FULL READ & ASSESSMENT (CANNOT SKIP)
- [ ] Read lesson completely as a student
- [ ] Take notes on confusion points
- [ ] Mark rushed/skeletal sections
- [ ] Score each criterion 0-10 before editing:
  - [ ] Narrative Quality (is it conversational teaching, not reference?)
  - [ ] Example Concreteness (real names, numbers, scenarios?)
  - [ ] Worked Examples (show actual outputs + quality checks?)
  - [ ] Progressive Teaching (Foundation → Intermediate → Advanced flow?)
  - [ ] Practical Guidance ("Try it now", copy-paste ready prompts?)
  - [ ] Completeness (all 7 sections + 5 templates?)
  - [ ] Template Depth (walkthroughs, not outlines?)

**GATE 1 PASS**: If all 7 criteria score < 10/10 before editing, PROCEED. If any already perfect, preserve it.
Document baseline scores before editing.

---

## STEP 2: STRUCTURE CHECK (CANNOT SKIP)
Lesson MUST have ALL 7 sections. If missing any, STOP and add complete section.

- [ ] **Section 1: Business Reality** (300-400 words)
  - Pain points with specific numbers
  - Cost of status quo
  - AI transformation benefits
  - 2025 metrics/ROI
  - Should feel: "This matters to me, here's why"

- [ ] **Section 2: 60-Second Quick Start** (100-150 words)
  - 2-3 practical options
  - Exact time + cost
  - Clear success indicator
  - Should feel: "I could do this right now"

- [ ] **Section 3: Progressive Mastery** (Main section, 1500+ words)
  - **Foundation Level** (3 exercises, ~300 words each)
    - Clear objective
    - Real scenario with context

    - Expert-level thinking
    - System design
    - Scalability focus

- [ ] **Section 4: Production Templates** (MUST be 5 templates minimum, 1000+ words)
  - Each template must have:
    - Business context ("When to use")
    - Complete workflow walkthrough
    - Specific prompts to copy
    - Expected outcomes

  - Performance optimization tips
  - Should feel: "I know what to do when things go wrong"

- [ ] **Section 7: Action Plan** (300+ words)
  - 7-Hour Quick Start (with time blocks)
  - 20-Hour Implementation (week breakdown)
  - 90-Day Transformation (month breakdown)
  - Success metrics at each stage

**GATE 2 PASS**: All 7 sections present and substantive (not skeleton). If any section < 50% of target length, EXPAND IT.

---

## STEP 3: NARRATIVE DEPTH CHECK (CANNOT SKIP)

For EACH exercise, ask:
- [ ] Does it have a "**Scenario:**" that explains the real-world situation?
- [ ] Does it have "**Your Mission:**" that clarifies what you're doing?
- [ ] Does it have a "**What you're learning:**" callout after completion?
- [ ] Are instructions written as prose guidance, not just bullet points?

For EVERY template, ask:
- [ ] Is there a worked example showing what to DO?
- [ ] Does it show what the OUTPUT should look like?
- [ ] Are there quality checks showing "✅ what to look for"?
- [ ] Does it explain WHY this approach (not just HOW)?

**GATE 3 PASS**: No exercise or template should feel skeletal. If it does, expand it.

---

## STEP 4: EXAMPLE CONCRETENESS CHECK (CANNOT SKIP)

Count these in the lesson:
- [ ] Real company names (not "Company X"): at least 3-5
- [ ] Real person names (not "[NAME]"): at least 5-10
- [ ] Specific numbers with context: at least 20+
- [ ] Before/after comparisons: at least 2-3
- [ ] Actual AI output examples: at least 3-5

If any count is too low, ADD CONCRETE EXAMPLES.

Examples of what NOT to have:
- ❌ "A company might spend X hours"
- ❌ "[USER] does [TASK]"
- ✅ "Sarah Chen at Acme Corp spent 12 hours"
- ✅ "Marcus Johnson realized he was losing $4,000/month"

**GATE 4 PASS**: Lesson has concrete specificity throughout. Reader knows real people doing real things.

---

## STEP 5: VOICE & TONE CHECK (CANNOT SKIP)

Read a random paragraph from your edited lesson. Compare to Lesson 1.

**Lesson 1 voice characteristics:**
- Conversational ("You'll know you've mastered...")
- Explanatory ("Here's why this matters...")
- Encouraging ("Try it now!")
- Direct ("Copy this exact prompt")
- Shows your thinking ("What you should see:")

**GATE 5 PASS**: Ask yourself honestly: "Does this feel like Lesson 1, or like an instruction manual?"
If instruction manual, rewrite 20-30% of prose to match Lesson 1 voice.

---

## STEP 6: PROGRESSIVE TEACHING CHECK (CANNOT SKIP)

Read JUST the Foundation → Intermediate → Advanced flow:

- [ ] Foundation Exercise 1 should be doable in 5 minutes with zero knowledge
- [ ] Foundation Exercise 2 should expand on Exercise 1
- [ ] Foundation Exercise 3 should show variation/application
- [ ] Intermediate Exercise 4 should require Foundation knowledge
- [ ] Intermediate Exercise 5 should add complexity layer
- [ ] Intermediate Exercise 6 should combine multiple concepts
- [ ] Advanced Exercise 7 should be genuinely difficult
- [ ] Advanced Exercise 8 should require system thinking
- [ ] Advanced Exercise 9 should feel like "now you're an expert"

**GATE 6 PASS**: Flow feels natural, not random. Each builds on previous.

---

## STEP 7: PRACTICAL COPYABILITY CHECK (CANNOT SKIP)

For EACH "quick start" and major section:

- [ ] Are there exact prompts to copy in code blocks?
- [ ] Could I copy and paste this into ChatGPT right now?
- [ ] Are placeholders clearly marked with [BRACKETS]?
- [ ] Would a beginner actually understand what to customize?

**GATE 7 PASS**: Someone could follow Exercise 1 from start to finish without being stuck.

---

## STEP 8: COMPARISON TO LESSON 1 (FINAL GATE - CANNOT SKIP)

Side-by-side comparison:

**Does your lesson have:**
- [ ] Specific dollar amounts / time savings? (Like Lesson 1's "$2,000+/month")
- [ ] Real scenario + names? (Like Lesson 1's "Sarah Chen, VP Marketing")
- [ ] Quality checks on outputs? (Like Lesson 1's "✅ what to look for")
- [ ] "What you're learning" moments? (Like Lesson 1's learning callouts)
- [ ] Pro tips section with 5 real techniques? (Like Lesson 1's 5 power techniques)
- [ ] Action plan with specific time blocks? (Like Lesson 1's daily/weekly breakdown)
- [ ] Teaching voice, not reference voice?

**GATE 8 PASS**: Score should now be 60+/70. If any criterion still < 8/10, REVISE THAT SECTION.

---

## FINAL VALIDATION (MUST DO)

Before moving to next lesson:

- [ ] Read Exercise 1 of your lesson as if you'd never heard of this topic
- [ ] Follow the instructions step-by-step
- [ ] Can you actually complete Exercise 1 without confusion?
- [ ] Does it feel like a good learning experience?
- [ ] Would you enjoy this lesson if you were a student?

**FINAL GATE PASS**: If answer to last question is "yes", APPROVED. Move to next lesson.
If "no" or "maybe", REVISE until "yes".

---

## DRIFT PREVENTION RULES

**These are non-negotiable:**

1. **Never accept "good enough"** - The rubric says 60+/70. If it's 59/70, FIX IT.
2. **Never skip gates** - If you can't pass a gate, the lesson isn't done.
3. **Always reference Lesson 1** - When in doubt, ask "Does Lesson 1 do this?"
4. **Document before/after scores** - This prevents you from lowering standards over time.
5. **If stuck, go deeper** - Don't skip a section because it's hard. Expand it.

---

## PER-LESSON WORKFLOW

1. Record baseline score (all 7 criteria, 0-10 each)
2. Read Lesson 1 Exercise 1 (refresh)
3. Read target lesson completely
4. Apply all 8 gates in order (CANNOT SKIP ANY)
5. Fix everything that doesn't pass
6. Re-score all 7 criteria
7. FINAL VALIDATION: Does it feel like Lesson 1?
8. Record final score
9. Move to next lesson

---
