# Excluded Lessons

This document lists lessons that were intentionally excluded from the database during Phase 3 migration.

## lesson-meta-guide-to-guide

**Reason for exclusion:** This is a meta-guide that explains how the lesson guides work, not an actual lesson for students to complete.

**Filename:** `lesson-meta-guide-to-guide.md`

**Status:** Parsed successfully (6 stages, 97/100 quality) but not inserted to database.

**Decision:** Skip insertion - this is documentation for content creators, not student curriculum.
