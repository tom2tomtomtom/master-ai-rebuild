# Lesson 3: ChatGPT Reasoning & Problem Solving - Solve Complex Business Challenges
*Master GPT-5's Advanced mode and o1 reasoning to tackle multi-step problems, strategic planning, and complex analysis*

## 💰 The Business Reality

Business problems are rarely simple—they require multi-step reasoning, trade-off analysis, and strategic thinking:
- **Strategic paralysis**: Leaders spend 8-12 hours per week analyzing complex decisions (hiring, market entry, product strategy), often with incomplete information and tight deadlines
- **Analysis bottleneck**: Consultants and analysts charge $200-500/hour for problem-solving frameworks, making deep strategic analysis prohibitively expensive for small teams
- **Decision fatigue**: 35% of business decisions are delayed or suboptimal due to cognitive overload from juggling multiple variables and constraints

GPT-5's November 2025 update brought automatic mode selection—including Advanced mode (o1-style reasoning) that "thinks" for 30-60 seconds before responding, dramatically improving complex problem-solving quality.

**Today's ROI:**
- Time saved: 8-10 hours/week on strategic analysis and problem-solving
- Money saved: $5,000+/month vs. hiring consultants or analysts
- Capability gained: McKinsey-level frameworks and multi-step reasoning on demand

## ⚡ BEFORE YOU START: Enable Advanced Mode

**This lesson uses Advanced mode (o1-style reasoning). Ensure setup is complete before starting exercises.**

### 🎯 Critical Features for This Lesson

This lesson requires ChatGPT Plus. Exercises use these advanced features:

- **Advanced Mode:** o1-style reasoning (step-by-step thinking)
- **GPT-4 Turbo or o1 Model:** For superior reasoning capabilities
- **Web Browsing:** For research-heavy problems (if needed)

### How to Enable: Advanced Mode (Plus Only)

Advanced Mode makes ChatGPT think step-by-step before responding.

**Step-by-step:**
1. Open https://chatgpt.com (ChatGPT Plus)
