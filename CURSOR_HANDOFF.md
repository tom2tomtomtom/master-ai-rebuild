## 🔧 YOUR WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Read the System
**Before generating anything, read these files:**

1. **AI_GENERATION_PROMPTS.md** (870 lines) ⭐ PRIMARY REFERENCE
   - Contains prompts for all 7 sections
   - Quality control checklist
   - Validation requirements
   - Production standards

2. **LESSON_TEMPLATE_DESIGN.md** (491 lines)
   - 7-section structure definition
   - Content specifications
   - Word count targets
   - Format requirements

3. **BUILD_TRACKER.md** (359 lines)
   - Tracks progress (UPDATE after each lesson)
   - Priority ordering
   - 87 lessons organized by phase

### Step 2: Generate First Lesson (Validation)
**Start with lesson-00 as proof-of-concept:**

```bash
# Read old lesson for context
/Users/tommyhyde/Code_Projects/Master-ai-backup/lesson-00-ai-tool-selection-guide.md

# Generate new lesson using AI_GENERATION_PROMPTS.md section prompts
# Save to:
/Users/tommyhyde/Code_Projects/master-ai-rebuild/lessons/lesson-00-ai-tool-selection-guide.md

# Show to Tom for approval before continuing
```

### Step 3: Batch Production (After Approval)
**Generate lessons in priority order from CURRICULUM_REDESIGN_2025.md:**

**Phase 1 - Critical (11 lessons, 44 hours):**

## 🎨 GENERATION PROCESS PER LESSON

### For Each Lesson:

**1. GATHER CONTEXT**
```bash
# First, read the curriculum document
cat /Users/tommyhyde/Code_Projects/master-ai-rebuild/CURRICULUM_REDESIGN_2025.md

# Check if old lesson exists in backup (some new lessons won't have old versions)
cat /Users/tommyhyde/Code_Projects/Master-ai-backup/lesson-[NUMBER]-[name].md

# Extract from curriculum:
- Lesson number and title
- Primary tool/platform
- Key 2025 updates
- Target audience/difficulty
- Agentic capabilities focus
```

**2. GENERATE EACH SECTION**

Use prompts from **AI_GENERATION_PROMPTS.md**:

**Section 1: Business Reality (15 min)**
- Use "SECTION 1: THE BUSINESS REALITY" prompt
- Quantify ROI ($X saved, Y hours/week)
- 150-250 words

**Section 2: Quick Win (20 min)**
- Use "SECTION 2: QUICK WIN" prompt
- Create tested, working 60-second prompt
- 200-300 words

**Section 3: Progressive Mastery (45 min)**
- Use "SECTION 3: PROGRESSIVE MASTERY" prompt
- Foundation → Intermediate → Advanced exercises
- 800-1,200 words

**Section 4: Production Templates (30 min)**
- Use "SECTION 4: PRODUCTION TEMPLATES" prompt
- 3-5 ready-to-use templates
- 600-900 words

**Section 5: Business Integration (25 min)**
- Use "SECTION 5: BUSINESS INTEGRATION" prompt
- Week/Month/Team rollout plans
- 500-700 words

**Section 6: Troubleshooting (20 min)**
- Use "SECTION 6: TROUBLESHOOTING & PRO TIPS" prompt
- 3-5 issues + 3-5 expert tips
- 400-600 words

**Section 7: Action Plan (20 min)**
- Use "SECTION 7: ACTION PLAN" prompt
- Week/Month/90-day milestones
- 400-500 words

**Total:** 3,400-4,700 words per lesson

**3. QUALITY CHECK**

Before saving, verify:
- [ ] All 7 sections present and complete
- [ ] ROI is quantified (not vague)
- [ ] Quick Win prompt is tested and works
- [ ] Production templates are complete
- [ ] Business examples (not toy problems)
- [ ] 45-60 minute total time
- [ ] Markdown formatting correct
- [ ] No outdated tool references

**4. SAVE & UPDATE TRACKER**

```bash
# Save lesson
/Users/tommyhyde/Code_Projects/master-ai-rebuild/lessons/lesson-[NUMBER]-[name].md

# Update BUILD_TRACKER.md
- Change [ ] to [x] for completed lesson
- Update phase progress
- Log completion in session notes
```

---

## ✅ QUALITY STANDARDS (CRITICAL)

### Every Lesson MUST Have:
1. **Quantified ROI** - Specific $ or hours saved
2. **Working Quick Win** - Tested 60-second prompt
3. **Production Templates** - 3-5 ready-to-use frameworks
4. **Business Examples** - Realistic scenarios (sales, marketing, product, etc.)
5. **Team Rollout** - How to scale to organization
6. **Tested Content** - All prompts/code work with current tools

### Every Lesson MUST NOT Have:
1. ❌ Vague claims ("might help", "could save time")
2. ❌ Untested prompts (everything must work)
3. ❌ Toy examples ("hello world" style)
4. ❌ Academic theory (focus on practice)
5. ❌ Outdated references (2024 or older)

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

### Per Lesson:
- Generation time: 3.5-4 hours
- Word count: 3,400-4,700 words
- Quality score: 8/10 minimum
- All prompts tested: 100%

### Overall Project:
- 87 lessons completed
- All phases done
- BUILD_TRACKER.md fully updated
- Ready for platform deployment

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL REMINDERS

### 1. Use 2025 Tool Versions
- ChatGPT: GPT-5 (not GPT-4)
- Claude: 4.5 Sonnet (not 3.5)
- Gemini: 2.5/3.0 (not 1.5)
- Update all tool capabilities to November 2025

### 2. Business Focus
This is B2B SaaS for Alt/Shift clients.
- Corporate buyers care about ROI
- Professionals need quick wins
- Teams need rollout guidance
- NOT academic education

### 3. Production Ready
Every template and prompt must be:
- Complete (no assembly required)
- Tested (actually works)
- Current (2025 tool versions)
- Business-focused (real use cases)

### 4. Update Tracker
After EACH lesson:
```bash
# Open BUILD_TRACKER.md
# Find the lesson in the phase list
# Change - [ ] to - [x]
# Update phase progress percentage
# Log in session notes
```
