## 🎨 ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

### Technique 1: Few-Shot Learning

Provide 1-2 excellent examples before generating:

```
Here are two examples of excellent "Business Reality" sections from our course:

[Example 1: Lesson X]
[Shows quantified pain points, specific ROI]

[Example 2: Lesson Y]
[Shows different industry context, same quality]

Now generate a "Business Reality" section for Lesson [N]: [Title] following the same style, specificity, and business focus.
```

### Technique 2: Iterative Refinement

Generate draft, then improve:

```
[Paste AI-generated content]

This is good, but revise to:
1. Make ROI more specific (add dollar amounts or hour savings)
2. Replace generic examples with named tools/features
3. Add one concrete statistic or benchmark
4. Ensure Quick Win prompt is tested and works with current [Tool]
5. Make all action items more specific (no "explore" or "try")
```

### Technique 3: Consistency Enforcement

Maintain terminology across lessons:

```
Use these definitions consistently:

- "Agentic AI" = AI systems that can operate autonomously for extended periods
- "Prompt engineering" = The systematic craft of writing instructions that produce optimal AI outputs
- "Multimodal" = AI systems that work with multiple types of input (text, images, audio, video)

Apply these in Lesson [N] for consistency with previous lessons.
```

### Technique 4: Audience-Specific Generation

Tailor for learner persona:

```
Generate this section specifically for:

Persona: [Sarah, Sales Director]
- Role: VP of Sales at mid-size B2B SaaS
- Experience: Beginner with AI (used ChatGPT casually)
- Goals: Improve team productivity, close more deals
- Pain points: Long email threads, proposal writing, CRM data entry
- Time: 2-3 hours/week for learning max

Adjust examples, ROI metrics, and use cases to speak directly to Sarah's world.
```
