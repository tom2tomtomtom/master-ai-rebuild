## 🚀 YOUR TWO PATHS FORWARD

### Path A: Build App First (3 days)
1. Follow **BUILD_TRACKER.md**
2. Ship MVP with current lessons
3. Generate revenue
4. Upgrade content later

### Path B: Perfect Content First (8 weeks)
1. Use **LESSON_TEMPLATE_DESIGN.md**
2. Rewrite all 73 lessons using template
3. Build app with perfected content
4. Launch with world-class quality

### Path C: Parallel Approach (Recommended)
1. **Week 1:** Build app (3 days) + Start rewrites (4 days)
2. **Week 2+:** App generates revenue while content improves
3. Update live lessons as rewrites complete
4. Best of both worlds

---

## 📋 QUICK START

**To start rewriting lessons:**
```bash
cd /Users/tommyhyde/Code_Projects/master-ai-rebuild
```

Then:
1. Open **CURRICULUM_REDESIGN_2025.md** - see what needs rewriting
2. Open **LESSON_TEMPLATE_DESIGN.md** - copy the template
3. Choose a lesson (recommend starting with lesson-00)
4. Fill in the template sections
5. Save to `lessons/lesson-XX-title.md`

---

## 🤔 WHICH PATH DO YOU WANT?

Ask me:
- "Start rewriting lesson-00" → I'll guide you through using the template
- "Build the app first" → I'll follow BUILD_TRACKER.md
- "Show me how to batch rewrite" → I'll create systematic workflow
- "Do both in parallel" → I'll coordinate both streams

**Current Status:** Template validated ✅ Ready to scale to 73 lessons
