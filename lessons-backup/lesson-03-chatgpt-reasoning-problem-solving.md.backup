# Lesson 3: ChatGPT Reasoning & Problem Solving - Solve Complex Business Challenges
*Master GPT-5's Advanced mode and o1 reasoning to tackle multi-step problems, strategic planning, and complex analysis*

## 💰 The Business Reality

Business problems are rarely simple—they require multi-step reasoning, trade-off analysis, and strategic thinking:
- **Strategic paralysis**: Leaders spend 8-12 hours per week analyzing complex decisions (hiring, market entry, product strategy), often with incomplete information and tight deadlines
- **Analysis bottleneck**: Consultants and analysts charge $200-500/hour for problem-solving frameworks, making deep strategic analysis prohibitively expensive for small teams
- **Decision fatigue**: 35% of business decisions are delayed or suboptimal due to cognitive overload from juggling multiple variables and constraints

GPT-5's November 2025 update brought automatic mode selection—including Advanced mode (o1-style reasoning) that "thinks" for 30-60 seconds before responding, dramatically improving complex problem-solving quality.

**Today's ROI:**
- Time saved: 8-10 hours/week on strategic analysis and problem-solving
- Money saved: $5,000+/month vs. hiring consultants or analysts
- Capability gained: McKinsey-level frameworks and multi-step reasoning on demand

## 🎓 Progressive Mastery

### Foundation Level (5 minutes)
*Master structured problem-solving frameworks*

## Exercise 1: Advanced Reasoning Frameworks (Complexity/Use Case Approach)

Your mission is to master the application of structured reasoning frameworks to different classes of business problems.

### Template 1: The Weighted Decision Matrix (Analytical Complexity)

| Element | Content |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Name** | Weighted Decision Matrix: Quantifying Clear Choices |
| **When to use** | - Choosing between 2-4 well-defined options (e.g., vendors, software, hiring profiles).<br>- When criteria can be clearly defined and weighted (e.g., cost, speed, quality).<br>- To remove emotional bias from a decision.<br>- To justify a decision to stakeholders with a clear, objective score.<br>- When the problem is analytical, not systemic. |
| **Setup Prompt** | ```
Apply a Weighted Decision Matrix to the following choice.

DECISION: [Choose between Option A, B, and C]

CRITERIA & WEIGHTS:
- [Criteria 1, e.g., Implementation Cost]: [20]%
- [Criteria 2, e.g., Time to Value]: [30]%
- [Criteria 3, e.g., Scalability]: [35]%
- [Criteria 4, e.g., Stakeholder Buy-in]: [15]%

OPTIONS:
- Option A: [Briefly describe Option A]
- Option B: [Briefly describe Option B]
- Option C: [Briefly describe Option C]

TASK:
1. Score each option against each criterion on a 1-10 scale (10 is best).
2. Calculate the weighted score for each option.
3. Provide a clear recommendation based on the highest weighted score.
4. Identify the single biggest risk for the recommended option.
``` |
| **Practice Scenario** | Your company needs to select a new CRM system. You have a budget of **$150,000** for the first year. **Option A** costs **$120,000** but has a 6-month implementation time. **Option B** costs **$180,000** but can be implemented in **2 months**. **Option C** costs **$90,000** but lacks a key feature that would require **$40,000** in custom development. You must choose one system to maximize long-term customer retention. |
| **Success Metrics** | ✅ The AI uses a 1-10 scoring scale for all criteria.<br>✅ The sum of all weights equals 100%.<br>✅ The final recommendation is based *only* on the calculated weighted score.<br>✅ The weighted score calculation is mathematically correct.<br>✅ The prompt is customized with the **$150,000** budget and **$40,000** custom development cost.<br>✅ The AI identifies the trade-off between cost and time-to-value.<br>✅ The output includes a clear risk for the recommended option.<br>✅ The final output is formatted as a clear, easy-to-read table. |

### Template 2: Scenario Planning & Pre-Mortem (Strategic Complexity)

| Element | Content |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Name** | Scenario Planning & Pre-Mortem: Navigating Uncertainty |
| **When to use** | - Evaluating high-stakes decisions with uncertain outcomes (e.g., market entry, major investment, product pivot).<br>- When the downside risk is potentially catastrophic.<br>- To force a team to consider failure modes *before* launch.<br>- When multiple external variables could significantly impact success.<br>- To develop robust contingency plans (hedges). |
| **Setup Prompt** | ```
Perform a Scenario Planning and Pre-Mortem analysis for this strategic decision.

DECISION: [Describe the strategic choice, e.g., launching a new product line]
INVESTMENT: [Total capital and time required]

KEY UNCERTAIN VARIABLES:
- Variable 1: [e.g., Competitor Response] - Range: [Minimal to Aggressive]
- Variable 2: [e.g., Customer Adoption Rate] - Range: [5% to 25%]
- Variable 3: [e.g., Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)] - Range: [$15 to $25]

SCENARIOS TO MODEL:
1. Worst Case (15% probability): All variables hit the pessimistic end.
2. Base Case (65% probability): Most likely values.
3. Best Case (20% probability): All variables hit the optimistic end.

PRE-MORTEM:
Imagine the project failed catastrophically in 18 months. What are the top 3 reasons?

TASK:
1. Model the financial outcome (e.g., Year 1 Profit/Loss) for each scenario.
2. Calculate the Expected Value (weighted average) of the decision.
3. Based on the Pre-Mortem, list 3 specific actions to take *now* to prevent those failure modes.
``` |
| **Practice Scenario** | Your company is considering a **$2.5 million** investment to launch a new subscription service. The service requires **10,000** paying customers to break even. Your market research suggests a customer adoption rate between **8%** (pessimistic) and **20%** (optimistic) of your existing **100,000** user base. The average monthly revenue per user (ARPU) is projected to be **$15**. |
| **Success Metrics** | ✅ The AI correctly uses the **$2.5 million** investment and **100,000** user base in its modeling.<br>✅ The financial outcome for each scenario is clearly quantified (e.g., Year 1 P/L).<br>✅ The Expected Value calculation is shown and is mathematically sound.<br>✅ The Pre-Mortem section generates failure reasons that are distinct from the initial risks.<br>✅ The AI provides 3 concrete, preventative actions (hedges).<br>✅ The sum of scenario probabilities equals 100%.<br>✅ The output clearly states the Go/No-Go recommendation based on the analysis.<br>✅ The AI identifies the break-even point of **10,000** customers. |

### Template 3: Multi-Stakeholder Prioritization (Organizational Complexity)

| Element | Content |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Name** | Multi-Stakeholder Prioritization: Resolving Conflicting Needs |
| **When to use** | - When a decision involves multiple departments with conflicting goals (e.g., Engineering vs. Sales vs. Finance).<br>- When resources (time, budget, people) are severely limited.<br>- To justify saying "no" to a powerful stakeholder with objective data.<br>- To find "win-win" or high-leverage solutions that satisfy multiple parties.<br>- When the problem is political or organizational, not just technical. |
| **Setup Prompt** | ```
Analyze and prioritize the following competing requests using a Multi-Stakeholder Prioritization framework.

LIMITED RESOURCE: [What is the bottleneck, e.g., 4 full-time engineers]
TIMEFRAME: [The period for which you are prioritizing, e.g., Q4]

STAKEHOLDER REQUESTS:
- Request A (Sales): [Briefly describe request, e.g., Feature X for a $500K deal]
- Request B (Engineering): [Briefly describe request, e.g., 6 weeks of technical debt reduction]
- Request C (Support): [Briefly describe request, e.g., Fix 5 high-priority bugs]
- Request D (Marketing): [Briefly describe request, e.g., New landing page for a campaign]

EVALUATION CRITERIA (Score 1-10 for each request):
- Business Impact (Weight 40%)
- Effort/Ease (Weight 30%)
- Political Cost of Delay (Weight 20%)
- Strategic Alignment (Weight 10%)

TASK:
1. Create a matrix scoring all requests against all criteria.
2. Calculate the weighted score for each request.
3. Provide a clear prioritization order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th).
4. Suggest a communication strategy for the stakeholder whose request is deferred.
``` |
| **Practice Scenario** | You have a team of **5** developers and a **6-week** sprint cycle. **Sales** needs Feature X, which will close a **$750,000** deal, but requires **4** developers for the full 6 weeks. **Engineering** needs **3** developers for **4** weeks to fix a critical security vulnerability. **Marketing** needs **1** developer for **2** weeks to launch a campaign expected to generate **$100,000** in leads. |
| **Success Metrics** | ✅ The AI correctly incorporates the **5** developers and **6-week** limit as constraints.<br>✅ The matrix clearly shows the weighted scores for all four requests.<br>✅ The prioritization order is logical and justified by the scores.<br>✅ The prompt is customized with the **$750,000** deal and **$100,000** lead generation figures.<br>✅ The AI suggests a sequencing or compromise (e.g., partial fulfillment) for at least one request.<br>✅ The communication strategy is tailored to the deferred stakeholder.<br>✅ The AI identifies the opportunity cost of choosing one request over the others.<br>✅ The final output is structured with clear headings for analysis and recommendation. |

### Template 4: Systems Thinking & Root Cause Analysis (Expert Complexity)

| Element | Content |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Name** | Systems Thinking & Root Cause: Solving Recurring Problems |
| **When to use** | - For chronic, recurring problems that resist simple fixes (e.g., high employee turnover, persistent quality issues).<br>- When you suspect the problem is a symptom of a deeper structural or process flaw.<br>- To identify the **leverage point** where a small change creates a large, lasting impact.<br>- To understand the **unintended consequences** of a proposed solution.<br>- When the problem requires second-order thinking. |
| **Setup Prompt** | ```
Apply Systems Thinking and a 5-Whys Root Cause Analysis to this recurring problem.

PROBLEM: [Describe the symptom, e.g., Customer churn increased by 15% last quarter]
SYMPTOMS: [List 3-5 observable effects]

SYSTEM MAPPING:
1. Identify the key components (people, processes, technology) involved in the problem.
2. Map the relationships and feedback loops between these components.

5-WHYS ANALYSIS:
- Problem: [State the problem]
- Why #1: [Answer]
- Why #2: [Answer]
- Why #3: [Answer]
- Why #4: [Answer]
- Why #5: [The Root Cause]

TASK:
1. Identify the single, most likely **Root Cause** from the 5-Whys.
2. Identify the **Leverage Point** in the system where a fix would have the greatest impact.
3. Propose a **Systemic Solution** (not a band-aid) to address the root cause.
4. Predict the **Top 2 Unintended Consequences** of implementing your solution.
``` |
| **Practice Scenario** | Your customer support team has a **25%** monthly turnover rate, costing the company an estimated **$15,000** per lost employee in hiring and training. The average ticket resolution time has increased from **4 hours** to **8 hours** in the last 6 months. Employees cite "burnout" and "lack of resources" in exit interviews. |
| **Success Metrics** | ✅ The AI uses the **25%** turnover rate and **$15,000** cost per employee in its analysis.<br>✅ The 5-Whys chain is logical and progresses from symptom to a systemic root cause (e.g., process or culture).<br>✅ The identified Leverage Point is distinct from the immediate symptom (e.g., "training" vs. "hiring").<br>✅ The proposed Systemic Solution is not a simple fix (e.g., "hire more people").<br>✅ The AI successfully predicts at least one negative unintended consequence.<br>✅ The output clearly maps the components and relationships in the system.<br>✅ The prompt is customized with the **4-hour** to **8-hour** resolution time change.<br>✅ The final recommendation focuses on a long-term structural change. |


**Scenario:** You're a product manager deciding whether to build Feature A (requested by 20% of users but high complexity) or Feature B (requested by 5% of users but quick to build). You have one sprint's worth of capacity. How do you decide systematically instead of going with gut feeling?

**Your Mission:** Use GPT-5 to apply proven problem-solving frameworks to business decisions.

**Framework Prompt Template:**

```
Apply the following problem-solving framework to my decision:

DECISION: [What I need to decide]
OPTIONS: [2-5 choices I'm considering]

USE THIS FRAMEWORK:

STEP 1: DEFINE THE PROBLEM
- What am I really trying to solve? (underlying goal, not surface issue)
- Who does this impact? (stakeholders)
- What constraints exist? (time, budget, resources, requirements)

STEP 2: IDENTIFY CRITERIA
What factors matter for evaluating options?
- Must-haves: [Non-negotiable requirements]
- Nice-to-haves: [Preferences]
- Metrics for success: [How to measure outcomes]

STEP 3: ANALYZE OPTIONS
For each option:
- Pros: [Benefits, opportunities]
- Cons: [Drawbacks, risks]
- Effort: [Time, cost, complexity]
- Impact: [Value created, problems solved]

STEP 4: SCORE & COMPARE
Rate each option on key criteria (1-10 scale):
| Criteria | Weight | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| [CRITERIA 1] | X% | Score | Score | Score |
| [CRITERIA 2] | X% | Score | Score | Score |
Weighted total: Calculate

STEP 5: RECOMMEND
- Best option: [Based on analysis]
- Why: [Key reasons]
- Implementation steps: [How to proceed]
- Risk mitigation: [What could go wrong, how to address]

OUTPUT: Walk me through this framework for MY decision systematically.
```

**Worked Example:**

```
DECISION: Feature A (complex but popular) vs Feature B (simple but niche)

CRITERIA & WEIGHTS:
- User impact (40%): How many users benefit?
- Revenue potential (25%): Will this drive sales?
- Development effort (20%): Engineering time required
- Strategic alignment (15%): Fits our roadmap?

SCORING:
Feature A: Complex, Popular
- User impact: 8/10 (20% of users, high value)
- Revenue potential: 7/10 (could drive upsells)
- Development effort: 3/10 (2 sprints estimated)
- Strategic alignment: 9/10 (key differentiator)
Weighted score: (8×0.4) + (7×0.25) + (3×0.2) + (9×0.15) = 6.7

Feature B: Simple, Niche
- User impact: 4/10 (5% of users)
- Revenue potential: 5/10 (small segment)
- Development effort: 9/10 (0.5 sprints)
- Strategic alignment: 5/10 (nice to have)
Weighted score: (4×0.4) + (5×0.25) + (9×0.2) + (5×0.15) = 5.2

RECOMMENDATION: Feature A, despite higher complexity
REASONING: User impact and strategic value outweigh effort difference
NEXT STEPS: Break Feature A into MVPs to ship value faster
```

**GPT-5's Advanced Mode Advantage:**

When you enable Advanced reasoning, GPT-5:
- Considers second and third-order effects ("If we build A, that enables X next quarter...")
- Identifies hidden assumptions ("This assumes our users value Y over Z...")
- Spots logical inconsistencies ("This criteria conflicts with that constraint...")
- Provides more nuanced trade-off analysis

**Pro Technique: Chain-of-Thought Prompting**

```
Think through this problem step-by-step:

PROBLEM: [Your challenge]

Step 1: What are the underlying root causes? (not just symptoms)
Step 2: What are all possible solutions? (generate 8-10, even unconventional ones)
Step 3: What are the constraints that eliminate some options? (narrow to 3-4 viable)
Step 4: What are the second-order consequences of each viable option? (what happens next)
Step 5: Which option best balances short-term needs and long-term goals?

Show your reasoning for each step.
```

This forces deeper analysis than "here are the pros and cons."

**Try It Now:**
Take a real decision you're facing (even small ones like "should I attend this conference?" or "which vendor to choose?"). Use the framework prompt. See if the structured analysis reveals insights you missed.

DECISION POINTS:
- Stage 1: Decide now
- Stage 2: Re-evaluate after [timeframe] with [new information]

FLEXIBILITY VALUE:
Does Option A or B give us more optionality for Stage 2? Sometimes suboptimal near-term choice keeps more options open.
```

**Use When:** Decisions with sequential stages, investment choices, strategic pivots  
**Time Saved:** 2-4 hours of modeling and analysis

### Template 4: Opportunity Cost Calculator

```
Calculate opportunity cost for this decision:

RESOURCES: [What's limited - money, time, people]
AMOUNT: [How much of limited resource]
TIMEFRAME: [Duration of commitment]

OPTION 1: [What you're considering]
- Direct cost: [Money, time, people required]
- Expected return: [Value created]
- Timeframe: [When we see results]
- ROI: [Return / Investment]

OPPORTUNITY COST ANALYSIS:
If we commit resources to Option 1, we CANNOT do:

Alternative 2: [Next best use of resources]
- Expected return: [Value we're giving up]
- ROI: [What we're sacrificing]

Alternative 3: [Third option]
- Expected return: [Value we're giving up]
- ROI: [What we're sacrificing]

TRUE COST OF OPTION 1:
- Direct cost: $[X]
- Opportunity cost: $[Y] (best alternative we're forgoing)
- Total economic cost: $[X + Y]

DECISION FRAMEWORK:
Option 1 is worth it if:
- Expected return > (Direct cost + Opportunity cost)
- Option 1 return > Alternative 2 return
- Strategic value justifies the sacrifice

IRREVERSIBILITY CHECK:
- Can we reverse this decision? At what cost?
- Are we closing off future options by committing now?
- Is there a way to test Option 1 before full commitment?

RECOMMENDATION: [Go/No-Go with reasoning including opportunity cost]
```

**Use When:** Resource allocation, hiring decisions, budget prioritization  
**Time Saved:** 1-2 hours of financial modeling

## 🔧 Troubleshooting & Pro Tips

### Common Issues

**Problem 1: "AI gave me generic analysis, not specific insights"**  
**Solution:** Provide more context—your industry, company stage, specific constraints, past experiences. Generic input = generic output.

**Problem 2: "I don't trust the AI's recommendation"**  
**Solution:** Good! Use AI for analysis, but make decisions yourself. Ask: "What am I missing?" instead of "What should I do?"

**Problem 3: "Analysis took longer than solving problem manually"**  
**Solution:** Start with simpler templates. Use AI for complex problems (8+ hours of analysis), not trivial ones.

### Pro Tips

**💡 Technique 1: "Devil's Advocate Mode"**  
After getting recommendation, ask: "Now argue against this recommendation. What are the strongest counter-arguments?" Forces balanced view.

**💡 Technique 2: "10x Thinking"**  
Ask: "If I needed 10x better results, what would I do differently?" Breaks incremental thinking.

**💡 Technique 3: "Regret Minimization"**  
Ask: "Imagine I'm 80 years old looking back. Which option would I regret NOT trying?" Clarifies what matters long-term.

### Intermediate Level (7 minutes)
*Multi-variable analysis and scenario planning*

**Exercise 2: Scenario Planning & Risk Analysis**

**Scenario:** You're considering a major business decision with uncertain outcomes—maybe launching in a new market, hiring aggressively, or pivoting your product strategy. You need to model different scenarios (best case, worst case, likely case) and understand risk exposure before committing resources.

**Your Mission:** Use GPT-5 for Monte Carlo-style scenario analysis without complex spreadsheets.

**Scenario Planning Prompt:**

```
I need scenario analysis for this decision:

DECISION: [What you're considering]
KEY VARIABLES: [List 3-5 uncertain factors that will determine outcomes]

For each variable, provide range:
- Variable 1: [Name] - Range: [pessimistic to optimistic]
- Variable 2: [Name] - Range: [pessimistic to optimistic]
- Variable 3: [Name] - Range: [pessimistic to optimistic]

SCENARIOS TO MODEL:

WORST CASE: Assume all variables hit pessimistic end
- What happens? [Describe outcome]
- Financial impact: [Estimate]
- How likely? [%]
- Can we survive this? [Yes/No + why]

BASE CASE: Assume most likely values for each variable
- What happens? [Describe outcome]
- Financial impact: [Estimate]
- How likely? [%]
- Is this acceptable? [Evaluation]

BEST CASE: Assume optimistic values
- What happens? [Describe outcome]
- Financial impact: [Estimate]
- How likely? [%]
- What would we do with this success? [Planning]

ANALYSIS:
- Expected value: Calculate weighted average of scenarios
- Risk/reward ratio: Is upside worth the downside risk?
- Decision: Go/No-Go with reasoning
- Hedges: How to limit downside while pursuing upside?

CRITICAL: Be realistic about probabilities. Most "worst cases" are more likely than we think.
```

**Worked Example - Market Expansion:**

```
DECISION: Expand from US to Europe (requires $500K investment over 6 months)

KEY VARIABLES:
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC): $50-200 per customer
- Conversion rate: 1-5% of trials
- Average deal size: $5K-15K annual contract
- Time to first revenue: 3-9 months
- Regulatory complexity: Low (1x) to High (3x normal effort)

WORST CASE (15% probability):
- CAC: $200, Conversion: 1%, Deal size: $5K, Time: 9 months, Regulatory: High
- Result: 6-month investment + 9 months delay = burn $750K, acquire 25 customers ($125K ARR)
- ROI: Negative $625K in Year 1
- Can we survive? Need to check cash runway - likely requires additional funding

BASE CASE (60% probability):
- CAC: $120, Conversion: 2.5%, Deal size: $10K, Time: 6 months, Regulatory: Medium
- Result: Invest $500K, acquire 100 customers in 12 months ($1M ARR)
- ROI: Positive $500K in Year 2
- Acceptable? Yes, if we can cover Year 1 cash burn

BEST CASE (25% probability):
- CAC: $80, Conversion: 4%, Deal size: $12K, Time: 4 months, Regulatory: Low
- Result: Invest $500K, acquire 250 customers in 10 months ($3M ARR)
- ROI: Positive $2.5M in Year 1
- Planning: Reinvest in additional European markets

EXPECTED VALUE:
(0.15 × -$625K) + (0.60 × $500K) + (0.25 × $2.5M) = $531K weighted

DECISION: GO - but with hedges
REASONING: Expected value is positive, base case is likely and acceptable, worst case is survivable if we raise bridge round first

HEDGES:
1. Secure $1M bridge funding before launch (covers worst case)
2. Start with UK only (reduce complexity, test assumptions)
3. Set 3-month checkpoint: If CAC > $150 or conversion < 2%, pause expansion
4. Hire experienced EU sales leader (reduce regulatory and GTM risk)
```

**Advanced Pattern: Pre-Mortem Analysis**

Instead of asking "what could go wrong?", do a pre-mortem:

```
Imagine it's 12 months from now and this decision failed catastrophically.

Pre-Mortem Exercise:
1. Describe the failure: What specifically went wrong?
2. Working backwards: What were the warning signs we should have seen?
3. Root cause: What wrong assumption or oversight led to this?
4. Could we have predicted this? What data would have revealed the risk?

Generate 5 different failure scenarios (different root causes for each).

Then: What can we do NOW to prevent each failure mode?
```

This reveals risks traditional analysis misses.

### Advanced Level (8 minutes)
*Strategic frameworks and multi-stakeholder problems*

**Exercise 3: Complex Multi-Stakeholder Problem Solving**

**Scenario:** You're a VP facing a decision that impacts multiple teams with conflicting priorities: Engineering wants to reduce technical debt (3-month project, no visible customer value), Sales wants new features for a big deal (6-week project), Support wants bug fixes (ongoing effort), and Finance wants to cut costs. You have one engineering team. How do you decide what to prioritize when everyone's needs are valid?

**Your Mission:** Use GPT-5 for multi-constraint optimization and stakeholder alignment.

**Multi-Stakeholder Framework Prompt:**

```
I have a complex decision with multiple stakeholders and conflicting priorities:

SITUATION: [Describe the challenge]
RESOURCES: [What's limited - time, money, people, etc.]

STAKEHOLDERS & THEIR PRIORITIES:
1. [Stakeholder 1]: Wants [X], because [reason], impact if denied: [consequence]
2. [Stakeholder 2]: Wants [Y], because [reason], impact if denied: [consequence]
3. [Stakeholder 3]: Wants [Z], because [reason], impact if denied: [consequence]
4. [Stakeholder 4]: Wants [W], because [reason], impact if denied: [consequence]

CONSTRAINTS:
- [Constraint 1: e.g., budget limit]
- [Constraint 2: e.g., deadline]
- [Constraint 3: e.g., resource capacity]

ANALYSIS NEEDED:

STEP 1: MAP IMPACTS
For each stakeholder request:
- Business impact (1-10): How critical is this to company success?
- Urgency (1-10): How time-sensitive?
- Dependencies: Does this block other work?
- Cost of delay: What happens if we wait 3/6/12 months?

STEP 2: IDENTIFY WIN-WIN OPTIONS
Are there solutions that satisfy multiple stakeholders?
- Could we combine requests?
- Are there 80/20 solutions (20% effort, 80% value)?
- Can we sequence work to satisfy everyone over time?

STEP 3: TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS
If we must choose:
- What's the opportunity cost of each option?
- What's the political cost of saying no to each stakeholder?
- What creates most long-term value vs. short-term gain?

STEP 4: RECOMMENDATION
- Primary focus: [What to do first and why]
- Secondary priorities: [What comes next]
- Deferred: [What to postpone with explanation]
- Communication plan: How to deliver decisions to each stakeholder

CRITICAL: Show your reasoning for trade-offs. Don't just pick based on who's loudest.
```

**Advanced Decision Matrix:**

```
I need to prioritize these 5 competing projects:

Project A: [Description, stakeholder, benefit]
Project B: [Description, stakeholder, benefit]
Project C: [Description, stakeholder, benefit]
Project D: [Description, stakeholder, benefit]
Project E: [Description, stakeholder, benefit]

EVALUATION CRITERIA (rank each 1-10):

Business Value:
- Revenue impact (direct or indirect)
- Cost reduction potential
- Strategic positioning
- Customer satisfaction improvement

Execution Feasibility:
- Technical complexity
- Resource availability
- Risk level
- Time to completion

Strategic Alignment:
- Fits company OKRs
- Enables future initiatives
- Competitive necessity
- Market timing

Create matrix scoring each project on all criteria.
Then: Apply different prioritization frameworks:
1. Weighted Score: Assign weights to criteria, calculate total
2. ICE Score: Impact × Confidence × Ease
3. RICE Score: Reach × Impact × Confidence / Effort
4. MoSCoW: Must have / Should have / Could have / Won't have

Compare results across frameworks. Where do they agree/disagree?
Recommendation: Which project(s) to pursue based on consensus + your strategic judgment.
```

**Expert-Level Pattern: Systems Thinking**

For truly complex problems, use systems thinking:

```
Apply systems thinking to this problem:

PROBLEM: [Your challenge]

SYSTEM MAP:
1. Identify key components: What are the main elements in this system?
2. Map relationships: How do these components affect each other?
3. Find feedback loops: Where do cause-and-effect cycle back?
4. Spot leverage points: Where can small changes create big impacts?

ANALYSIS:
- What are the unintended consequences of each solution?
- Where might "fixing" one problem create new problems?
- What are the non-obvious ripple effects?
- How does this interact with other company systems (sales, product, ops)?

SECOND-ORDER THINKING:
- If we do X, then Y happens
- If Y happens, then Z happens
- If Z happens, what does that mean for our original problem?

Draw out the system dynamics. Where's the real leverage?
```

This prevents "whack-a-mole" problem solving where you create new issues.

### Template 3: Decision Tree for Complex Choices

```
Build a decision tree for this multi-stage decision:

DECISION: [Your choice]

STRUCTURE:

STAGE 1: [First decision point]
├─ Option A: [Description]
│   ├─ Outcome probability: X%
│   ├─ If this happens → Stage 2A
│   └─ Expected value: $X
│
└─ Option B: [Description]
    ├─ Outcome probability: Y%
    ├─ If this happens → Stage 2B
    └─ Expected value: $Y

STAGE 2A: [Next decision if we chose A]
├─ Option A1: [Description, probability, value]
└─ Option A2: [Description, probability, value]

STAGE 2B: [Next decision if we chose B]
├─ Option B1: [Description, probability, value]
└─ Option B2: [Description, probability, value]

CALCULATE:
Expected value of each full path:
- Path A → A1: [probability × value]
- Path A → A2: [probability × value]
- Path B → B1: [probability × value]
- Path B → B2: [probability × value]

OPTIMAL PATH: [Which sequence maximizes expected value]
REASONING: [Why this path vs. alternatives]

DECISION POINTS:
- Stage 1: Decide now
- Stage 2: Re-evaluate after [timeframe] with [new information]

FLEXIBILITY VALUE:
Does Option A or B give us more optionality for Stage 2? Sometimes suboptimal near-term choice keeps more options open.
```

**Use When:** Decisions with sequential stages, investment choices, strategic pivots  
**Time Saved:** 2-4 hours of modeling and analysis
