# Lesson 15: Claude Projects - Persistent Context & Team Collaboration
*Master Claude Projects for persistent knowledge bases, team workflows, and continuous context management*

## 💰 The Business Reality

Knowledge management without AI creates constant friction:
- **Context loss**: Teams repeat information across conversations, losing 3-5 hours/week per person to re-explaining context
- **Knowledge silos**: Institutional knowledge lives in people's heads or scattered across docs, making onboarding slow and creating bus factor risk
- **Collaboration overhead**: Sharing context between team members requires copying/pasting docs or email chains—fragmented and inefficient

Claude Projects enable persistent context management—upload documents once, all future conversations have full context without re-uploading.

**Today's ROI:**
- Time saved: 5-8 hours/week per person on context/knowledge management
- Money saved: $10,000-30,000+/year vs. knowledge management systems
- Capability gained: Instant AI assistance with full project context for entire team

### Intermediate Level (7 minutes)
*Advanced Project techniques for team collaboration and workflow integration*

**Exercise 2: Multi-Team Project Management**

- Quarterly: Update custom instructions if needed
- Annually: Comprehensive audit + refresh


USAGE TRACKING:

Monitor:
- How often project used
- Which docs referenced most
- Where gaps exist (questions not answerable)

Iterate:
- If docs referenced >80%: Keep
- If docs referenced <20%: Consider removing
- If questions unanswerable: Add docs to fill gap


ENTERPRISE WORKFLOWS:

1. ONBOARDING:
New employee gets access to:
- Core Org Project (learn company)
- Function Project (learn role)
- Team Project (learn team specifics)
→ Claude helps onboard with full context

2. CROSS-TEAM COLLABORATION:
Team needs input from another function:
- Access relevant Function Project
- Claude helps translate requirements/constraints
- Reduces miscommunication

3. DECISION MAKING:
Need to make strategic decision:
- Access relevant Projects
- Claude synthesizes all context
- Provides recommendation with reasoning

4. PROBLEM SOLVING:
Hit a blocker or question:
- Claude can reference all relevant Projects
- Multiple perspectives considered
- Solution grounded in company knowledge
```

**Project Lifecycle Management:**

```
PROJECT STATES:

ACTIVE:
- In active use
- Knowledge base maintained weekly
- Team accessing regularly
- Critical to current operations

MATURE:
- Used regularly but not critical
- Knowledge base reviewed monthly
- Can stay active indefinitely

ARCHIVED:
- Project complete or inactive
- Knowledge base frozen (no updates)
- Searchable for historical reference
- Can be reactivated if needed

SUNSETTING:
- Project ending
- Documentation in final state
- Knowledge being migrated elsewhere
- Final archive scheduled

ARCHIVE PROCESS:

When project is complete:
1. Final knowledge base review (is everything documented?)
2. Archive announcement to team
3. Create summary document (what was accomplished)
4. Export all project docs for long-term storage
5. Mark as archived
6. Make searchable for future reference


KNOWLEDGE PRESERVATION:

Key learnings:
- Document lessons learned
- Capture decisions made (why, not just what)
- Save templates/processes created
- Archive case studies / examples

This becomes institutional knowledge
that next project can learn from.
