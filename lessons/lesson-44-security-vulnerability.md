## 💰 Reality

Security incidents cost:
- Average breach: $4.3 million
- Downtime per hour: $5,000-50,000
- Compliance violations: $10,000-1,000,000

AI security:
- Real-time vulnerability scanning
- Automated patching recommendations
- Zero-day detection
- Cost: $100-500/month vs. $200,000+/year for security team
