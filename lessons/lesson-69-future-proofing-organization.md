## 🎓 Progressive Mastery (9 Exercises)

### Foundation Level

**Exercise 1: Understand Agent Capabilities (5 min)**

*Objective*: Grasp what agents can do (and limitations)

**Agent basics:**
```
AGENT vs. AI ASSISTANT:

AI Assistant (today):
- "Generate email"
- "Analyze data"
- "Write code"
- Human decides what to do with output

Agent (2026):
- "Process customer orders end-to-end"
- Autonomously: Receive order → Check inventory → Bill customer → Ship
- Escalates to human only if uncertain

Agent characteristics:
- Goal-oriented (achieve result, not just generate text)
- Autonomous (takes actions without asking)
- Error recovery (if something fails, tries different approach)
- Learning (improves over time)

What agents can do (2026):
- Routine business processes (order processing, invoice payment)
- Decision support (approve loan, decide hiring)
- Research (find and synthesize information)
- Customer service (interact, resolve without human)
- Coding (write full features, tests, deploy)

What agents still need humans for:
- Novel situations (never seen before)
- High-stakes decisions (major strategy)
- Creativity (new product ideas)
- Human judgment (what customers want)
```

**Exercise 2: Assess Your Automation Opportunity (5 min)**

*Objective*: Find where agents will impact you most

**Analysis:**
```
Q1: What % of your work is routine/rule-based?
- Sales: Cold outreach, email follow-up (40% could be agent)
- Support: FAQ, ticket routing (60% could be agent)
- Finance: Invoice processing, reconciliation (70% could be agent)
- HR: Screening, onboarding (50% could be agent)
- Dev: Code generation, testing (40% could be agent)

Q2: What processes are rule-based?
- IF customer_score > 700 THEN approve_loan
- IF inventory < 10 THEN reorder
- IF no_response_5_days THEN escalate
- These are perfect for agents

Q3: Where could agent reduce headcount?
- Support: 50 people → 20 people + 10 agents
- Finance: 20 people → 8 people + 5 agents
- Sales: 100 people → 80 people + agents handling routine

Opportunity: [X]% of work could be automated
Value: [Y] FTE equivalent
Timing: 2026-2027
```

**Exercise 3: Prepare Processes for Automation (5 min)**

*Objective*: Make your processes agent-ready

**Preparation:**
```
Today (2024): Messy human processes
- If-then rules are implicit (in people's heads)
- Exceptions are handled ad-hoc
- Lots of judgment calls
- Hard for AI to automate

Future-ready (2026): Explicit processes
- Rules documented explicitly
- Exceptions programmed
- Decision criteria clear
- Easy for agents to automate

Action: Document your processes
- For each routine task: What are the rules?
- When do exceptions happen?
- How are they handled?
- Can a rule be written?

Example - Loan approval:
Current: Loan officer uses judgment
Future-ready:
  IF credit_score > 700 AND income > 3x_loan THEN approve
  IF credit_score < 700 THEN escalate_to_human
  IF income < 3x_loan THEN escalate_to_human

Future agents use these rules
Reduces human touch from 100% to only exceptions
```

### Intermediate Level

**Exercise 4: Plan Multi-Agent Systems (7 min)**

*Objective*: Understand how multiple agents work together

**System design:**
```
Single agent (2025): Does one thing
- Email-writing agent
- Code-generation agent
- Data-analysis agent

Multi-agent system (2026):
- Order-processing agent
- Inventory-checking agent
- Billing agent
- Shipping agent
- They work together end-to-end

How it works:
1. Order arrives
2. Order agent receives it
3. Order agent delegates to inventory agent: "Check stock"
4. Inventory agent responds: "In stock"
5. Order agent delegates to billing agent: "Bill customer"
6. Billing agent responds: "Billed $X"
7. Order agent delegates to shipping agent: "Ship order"
8. Shipping agent responds: "Order shipped"
9. Order agent: "Done, customer notified"

Complexity: Multi-agent coordination
Benefit: Complete end-to-end automation
Timeline: First multi-agent systems 2026

Preparation:
- Design workflows as multi-step
- Identify hand-off points
- Make inputs/outputs clear
- Agents will orchestrate

Your job as human:
- Define overall goal ("Process order end-to-end")
- Agents figure out steps
- You oversee exceptions only
```

**Exercise 5: Prepare for Specialized Models (7 min)**
