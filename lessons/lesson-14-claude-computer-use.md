# Lesson 14: Claude Computer Use - Autonomous Computer Control & GUI Automation
*Master Claude's groundbreaking computer control capability to automate complex multi-step tasks across applications*

## 💰 The Business Reality

Manual computer tasks consume massive amounts of professional time:
- **Repetitive task burden**: Knowledge workers spend 8-12 hours/week on repetitive computer tasks (data entry, file management, report generation, cross-application workflows) that could be automated but aren't due to complexity
- **Cross-application friction**: Tasks requiring 3+ different applications (Excel → CRM → Email → Slack) take 40-60% longer due to context switching and manual data transfer, costing 5-8 hours/week per employee
- **Automation complexity gap**: Traditional automation tools (Zapier, scripts) require technical skills or only work for simple linear workflows, leaving 70% of automation opportunities untapped

Claude's Computer Use capability (October 2024, refined 2025) enables AI to control your computer autonomously—taking screenshots, moving mouse, clicking, typing—to complete multi-step tasks across any application, breaking through the complexity barrier.

**Today's ROI:**
- Time saved: 8-12 hours/week on repetitive multi-application tasks
- Money saved: $15,000-30,000+/year vs. hiring virtual assistants or automation developers
- Capability gained: Automate complex workflows previously impossible without custom software development

*   Any task that requires unattended, scheduled execution with robust **error detection, logging, and recovery** mechanisms.
*   Implementing a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline step that needs to handle transient failures.

**Setup Prompt:**

```markdown
Execute a daily health check on our primary web application, including robust error handling and logging.

**TASK:** Perform a 3-step health check on the 'Product Dashboard' at [https://app.company.com/dashboard].

**CHECK STEPS:**
1. **Login Check:** Navigate to the URL and successfully log in with credentials [USER] and [PASS].
2. **Data Load Check:** Navigate to the 'Analytics' tab and verify that the 'Total Users' metric loads a number greater than [1000].
3. **API Health Check:** Click the 'Settings' icon and verify that the 'API Status' indicator is green.

**ERROR HANDLING:**
- **IF** Login fails: Take a screenshot of the error message. **RETRY** the login once after a [30] second delay. If the second attempt fails, log 'CRITICAL FAILURE: Login' and **STOP** the entire check.
- **IF** Data Load fails (e.g., metric is missing or < [1000]): Log 'WARNING: Data Load Issue'. Continue to the next step.
- **IF** API Health Check fails (indicator is red): Take a screenshot. Log 'CRITICAL FAILURE: API Down'.

**PROCESS STEPS:**
1. Execute the three checks sequentially.
2. Log all actions and errors to a master log file: /home/ubuntu/health_check_log_[DATE].txt
3. At the end, send a summary email to [ops@company.com] with the overall status (GREEN/YELLOW/RED).

Start the process now.
```

**Practice Scenario:**

An operations team runs a daily health check that takes **15 minutes** manually. The check is critical for system stability. The goal is to automate this check, including the ability to handle a common transient login failure. The expected 'Total Users' metric is **15,500**. The system should be tested with a simulated transient failure on the first login attempt.

**Success Metrics (Checkboxes):**
- [ ] Claude attempted the first login and simulated a failure.
- [ ] Claude correctly waited for the specified **30** second delay.
- [ ] Claude successfully performed the second login attempt.
- [ ] The 'Data Load Check' was performed, and the 'Total Users' metric was verified against the expected **15,500** (or > **1000**).
- [ ] The 'API Health Check' was performed, and the status was verified.
- [ ] The entire process was logged to the `health_check_log_[DATE].txt` file, including the retry attempt.
- [ ] The final summary email was simulated to be sent to `ops@company.com`.
- [ ] The final status reported was **GREEN** (assuming the retry succeeded and no other errors occurred).
- [ ] The process demonstrated the ability to detect and recover from a transient failure.
- [ ] The total time taken, including the delay, was less than **5 minutes**.

### What You're Learning

✅ **The Principle of Explicit Instruction:** Claude's computer use is only as good as the prompt. You learn to break down complex, multi-application tasks into explicit, sequential steps that leave no room for ambiguity.
✅ **State-Aware Automation:** You understand that Claude operates by observing the screen state (screenshots) and making decisions. This requires prompts to include clear verification steps and expected outcomes at each stage.
✅ **Conditional Logic for Business Rules:** You master the use of `IF/THEN/ELSE` structures within prompts to handle real-world business complexity, such as triaging support tickets or validating data before processing.
✅ **Resilience and Error Handling:** You learn to design workflows that anticipate failure (e.g., login errors, slow loading) and include explicit instructions for retries, logging, and graceful skipping to ensure the overall process is robust.
✅ **The Power of Abstraction:** You move beyond simple single-step commands to orchestrate a series of actions across disparate systems (web, desktop, file system) using a single, high-level natural language instruction.

### Try It Now: Build Your First Production-Grade Workflow

Follow these steps to build and test a robust, multi-step automation using one of the templates above.

1.  **Select a Template:** Choose the **Template 4: Autonomous Daily Health Check** as your starting point.
2.  **Identify a Target:** Select a simple, non-critical web application or website (e.g., a personal dashboard, a public status page) to use as your target system.
3.  **Define the Checks:** Modify the `CHECK STEPS` in the template to include three specific, verifiable actions on your chosen target (e.g., "Verify logo is present," "Check the number of items in the cart," "Confirm the last updated date is today").
4.  **Set the Failure Point:** Introduce a deliberate, temporary failure into your prompt's `ERROR HANDLING` section (e.g., instruct Claude to use an incorrect password once, or look for a metric that is temporarily hidden).
5.  **Refine the Prompt:** Write the final `Setup Prompt` with real, non-sensitive data and clear instructions for logging and reporting. Use the `[BRACKETS]` for any variable data.
6.  **Execute and Observe:** Run the prompt in Claude and observe its behavior, specifically watching how it handles the deliberate failure and the subsequent recovery/logging steps.
7.  **Review the Log:** Check the generated log file (`health_check_log_[DATE].txt`) to ensure the failure, the retry, and the final status were all correctly recorded.

### Final Success Metric

✅ **Your first production-grade workflow is complete:** You have successfully executed a multi-step, cross-application automation that included explicit conditional logic, demonstrated recovery from a transient failure, and produced a structured log file and final status report.


### Intermediate Level (7 minutes)
*Complex workflows, decision-making, and conditional logic*

**Exercise 2: Advanced Automation with Conditional Logic**

**Scenario:** You manage customer support tickets. Each ticket requires different handling based on priority, category, and customer tier. Manual triage takes 2 hours/day. Automate it with Claude making intelligent decisions.

**Your Mission:** Master complex automation with decision trees and conditional logic.

**Advanced Workflow Pattern:**

**Conditional Task Automation**

```
"Automate support ticket triage with intelligent decision-making.

TICKET SOURCE: [Support platform URL]
LOGIN: [Credentials when prompted]

WORKFLOW:

FOR EACH NEW TICKET:

STEP 1: READ TICKET
- Ticket ID
- Subject line
- Customer name
- Customer tier (Free / Pro / Enterprise)
- Priority (set by customer)
- Category (Bug / Feature Request / Question)
- Description (first 200 words)

STEP 2: ANALYZE & CATEGORIZE
Determine:
- Actual priority (may differ from customer's)
  • CRITICAL: System down, data loss, security
  • HIGH: Major feature broken, blocking work
  • MEDIUM: Annoying bug, feature request
  • LOW: Question, minor issue

- Complexity:
  • SIMPLE: Answer in knowledge base
  • MEDIUM: Requires investigation
  • COMPLEX: Engineering escalation needed

STEP 3: DECISION TREE

IF Priority = CRITICAL:
  → Assign to: On-call engineer
  → Slack alert: #incidents channel
  → Set SLA: 1 hour response
  → Add tag: 'critical-incident'

ELSE IF Priority = HIGH AND Customer = Enterprise:
  → Assign to: Senior support
  → Email notification to account manager
  → Set SLA: 2 hour response
  → Add tag: 'enterprise-priority'

ELSE IF Category = Bug AND Complexity = COMPLEX:
  → Assign to: Engineering queue
  → Create Jira ticket
  → Link to support ticket
  → Set SLA: 24 hour response

ELSE IF Category = Question AND Complexity = SIMPLE:
  → Search knowledge base for answer
  → Post answer as draft response
  → Assign to: Support agent for review
  → Set SLA: 4 hour response

ELSE:
  → Assign to: General support queue
  → Set SLA: 8 hour response
  → Add appropriate tags

STEP 4: LOG ACTIONS
Create log entry:
- Ticket ID
- Priority assigned
- Queue assigned
- Reasoning (why this decision)
- SLA set
- Time processed

STEP 5: REPEAT
Process next ticket.

SAFEGUARDS:
- Don't auto-respond to customers (draft only)
- Flag any ticket you're uncertain about
- If customer tier = Enterprise, always involve human
- Screenshot each ticket processed

Process tickets from last 2 hours as test run."
```

**What This Enables:**
- Claude reads context (ticket content, customer data)
- Makes intelligent decisions (not simple if/then)
- Takes different actions based on analysis
- Works across multiple systems (support platform, Slack, Jira, etc.)
- Maintains audit trail

**Advanced Pattern: Data Processing Pipeline**

```
"Process monthly expense reports with validation and categorization.

SOURCE: Email inbox → Search 'Expense Report' in last 30 days

FOR EACH EMAIL:

1. DOWNLOAD ATTACHMENT (Excel file)

2. VALIDATE DATA:
   - All required columns present?
   - Dates in valid format?
   - Amounts are numbers?
   - Receipts attached match line items?

   IF validation fails:
   → Reply to sender: 'Expense report has errors: [LIST ISSUES]'
   → Move to 'Needs Correction' folder
   → Skip to next email

3. CATEGORIZE EXPENSES:
   Read each line item, categorize:
   - Travel (flights, hotels, meals while traveling)
   - Office (supplies, software, equipment)
   - Marketing (ads, events, sponsorships)
   - Client (client dinners, gifts)
   - Other

   Add category column to spreadsheet

4. FLAG FOR REVIEW:
   IF any item > $500 → Flag as 'Requires Manager Approval'
   IF category = 'Other' > 20% of total → Flag as 'Unusual Distribution'
   IF total > employee's monthly limit → Flag as 'Over Budget'

5. SUMMARIZE:
   Create summary tab in Excel:
   - Total by category
   - Items flagged for review
   - Comparison to budget
   - Variance explanation needed

6. EXPORT & ROUTE:
   - Save to: /Accounting/Expense Reports/[MONTH]/[EMPLOYEE].xlsx
   - Upload to: [Accounting system URL]
   - IF flagged:
     → Email manager for approval
   - ELSE:
     → Auto-approve in accounting system

7. LOG:
   Append to master log:
   - Employee name
   - Total amount
   - Categories breakdown
   - Flags (if any)
   - Status (Approved / Pending)
   - Date processed

Process all pending expense reports. Show me summary when done."

   - If can't proceed: Alert user, show screenshot
   - Don't process incomplete data

4. UNEXPECTED POPUP/DIALOG:
   - Screenshot the popup
   - Try common actions (Close, Cancel, OK)
   - If blocks progress: Log and move to next task
   - Report: 'Unexpected dialog on [APP] - see screenshot'

5. APPLICATION CRASH:
   - If app becomes unresponsive (no screenshot changes for 60s)
   - Force quit application
   - Wait 10 seconds
   - Reopen and retry task
   - If crashes again: Skip task, log error

6. MISSING FILE/FOLDER:
   - Check common alternate locations
   - Search file system for filename
   - If not found: Alert user, list expected location
   - Don't proceed with task that requires this file

LOGGING STRATEGY:
Create daily log: /Logs/Automation_[DATE].txt

For each task:
[TIMESTAMP] Starting: [TASK NAME]
[TIMESTAMP] Status: [SUCCESS / RETRY / FAILED]
[TIMESTAMP] Details: [What happened]
[TIMESTAMP] Screenshot: [Path if error]

REPORTING TIERS:
- GREEN: All tasks completed successfully
- YELLOW: Some tasks failed but automation mostly worked
- RED: Critical failures, manual intervention needed

Post appropriate status to Slack with summary."

## 🔧 Troubleshooting & Pro Tips

**Problem 1: "Computer Use is slow"**
**Solution:** Expected—Claude takes screenshots, analyzes, then acts. Optimize by being specific about what to click/where to look.

**Problem 2: "Can't find button/element on screen"**
**Solution:** Provide exact location or description. "Click the blue 'Submit' button in bottom right corner."

**Problem 3: "Automation got stuck"**
**Solution:** Add timeout logic. "If no progress in 2 minutes, take screenshot and ask me for help."

**💡 Pro Tip 1: "Verification Screenshots"**
Always request screenshots of completed tasks. Visual proof + easier to debug.

**💡 Pro Tip 2: "Incremental Testing"**
Test with 1-5 items first, then scale to hundreds. Catch errors before mass processing.

**💡 Pro Tip 3: "Error Logs"**
Maintain detailed logs. When automation fails, logs show exactly where and why.

**💡 Pro Tip 4: "Human in Loop"**
For high-stakes tasks, have Claude draft/prepare but require human approval before execution.

**💡 Pro Tip 5: "Version Control"**
Document your automation workflows. When they break (app UI changes), you can fix quickly.
