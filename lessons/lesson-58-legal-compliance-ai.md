# Lesson 58: AI-Powered Legal & Compliance

## 💰 Business Reality

Traditional legal work is manual and expensive:
- **Contract review**: $500-2,000 per contract (attorney time)
- **Compliance monitoring**: Manual, reactive (miss regulations)
- **Risk assessment**: Slow, biased (human judgment)
- **Document preparation**: Hours per document
- **Regulatory tracking**: Can't keep up with changes

**Cost for mid-sized company**:
- General counsel: $200K-300K
- Outside counsel: $100K-300K/year
- Compliance staff: $150K
- Fines from non-compliance: $200K-500K
- **Total: $650K-1.15M annually**

**AI-powered legal transforms this:**

**For Startups**: Can't afford lawyer → AI handles basics
**For Mid-Market**: In-house + outside counsel → AI + 1 counsel
**For Enterprise**: Large legal team with gaps → AI handles routine, lawyers focus on strategy

### 2025 Metrics & ROI
