## ⚡ BEFORE YOU START: Using Connectors with Agents

**Connectors let agents read from and interact with your work tools. This section covers setup for agent integrations.**

### What Are Connectors?

Connectors are integrations that allow Claude to:
- **Read** from Gmail, Slack, Google Docs, Google Sheets, GitHub
- **Analyze** content in these tools directly
- **Reference** this data in agent workflows
- **Build workflows** that pull data from work tools

**Real-world agent example:** An agent that monitors Gmail for customer issues, checks support docs in Sheets, pulls code from GitHub, and Slack-messages the team with recommendations—all automatically.

### Available Connectors (Pro Only)

These integrations are available with Claude Pro:

| Connector | What It Does | Use Cases |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Gmail** | Read emails, draft responses | Customer support agents, inbox triage, automatic replies |
| **Slack** | Read channel messages, post updates | Team notifications, meeting summaries, workflow alerts |
| **Google Docs** | Read and edit documents | Documentation updates, report generation, content editing |
| **Google Sheets** | Read and modify spreadsheets | Data analysis, report generation, record updates |
| **GitHub** | Browse repositories, read code | Code analysis, documentation, repository monitoring |

### How Connectors Enable Agents

**Without Connectors:** Agent needs data → You manually give it data → Agent analyzes → You implement changes

**With Connectors:** Agent reads data → Agent analyzes → Agent implements changes (posts to Slack, updates Sheets)

**Example Agent Workflow with Gmail + Sheets Connector:**
1. Agent reads new support emails (Gmail)
2. Agent categorizes issues
3. Agent updates support metrics spreadsheet (Sheets)
4. Agent posts summary to team (Slack)
5. All without human involvement

### How to Enable: Connect Gmail (Pro Only)

**Step-by-step:**
1. Open https://claude.ai
2. Click Settings (⚙️ icon, top right)
3. Find "Connected Apps" or "Integrations"
4. Click "Connect" next to Gmail
5. You'll be redirected to Google login
6. Review permissions ("Claude wants access to read your emails")
7. Click "Allow"
8. Confirm in Claude

**After connecting:** In conversations, you can say "Look at my latest emails" and Claude will read them directly.

### How to Enable: Other Connectors

**For Slack, Google Docs, Google Sheets, GitHub:** Same process
1. Settings → Connected Apps
2. Click "Connect" for desired tool
3. Authorize permissions
4. Confirm in Claude

### When to Use Connectors with Agents

**Great fit for agents:**
- ✅ Agents that need real-time data from email/Slack/Docs
- ✅ Workflows that update shared docs/sheets
- ✅ Team notification agents (post to Slack)
- ✅ Code analysis agents (access GitHub)

**Not ideal for agents:**
- ❌ One-off questions (just ask Claude directly)
- ❌ Sensitive data (be careful what you authorize)
- ❌ Tasks that don't need live tool access

### 🔗 For Complete Connectors Setup

This lesson covers agents. For detailed connector configuration:

**→ See Lesson 9.5: Claude Complete Settings & Setup Guide**
- Step-by-step connector setup for each tool
- Permission scopes explained
- Privacy and data security
- Troubleshooting connection issues

## 💰 The Business Reality

Complex workflows require human oversight:
- **Sequential decision-making tax**: Tasks requiring 5-10 sequential decisions (each dependent on previous results) need human oversight, limiting true automation to simple linear flows
- **Reasoning bottleneck**: Problems requiring deep analysis across multiple sources before deciding next steps can't be automated without humans reading outputs and deciding
- **Orchestration complexity**: Multi-tool workflows (CRM → database → analytics → notification) require humans to orchestrate, creating bottlenecks

Claude Agents enable autonomous complex workflows—Claude reasons about problems, makes decisions, takes action, evaluates results, and adjusts approach—completing intricate multi-step tasks without human intervention.

**Today's ROI:**
- Time saved: 10-20 hours/week on complex workflows currently requiring human oversight
- Autonomy gain: Tasks that couldn't be automated now run unattended
- Capability: Enterprise-grade workflow automation without custom development

## ⚡ Your First Agent in 60 Seconds

Tell Claude to solve a problem autonomously:

### Prompt:

```
I need you to solve this business problem autonomously.

PROBLEM: Find and analyze our top 5 customer churn risks this week.

WORKFLOW:
1. Check customer activity database (low activity = risk)
2. Review recent support tickets (complaints = risk)
3. Analyze contract renewal dates (approaching expiration = risk)
4. Score risk level (critical / high / medium)
5. Generate summary report with recommended actions

Use your reasoning to decide how to proceed. Make decisions autonomously.
Stop only when analysis complete and report generated.

Start now.
```

### What Happens:

Claude will:
- Break down problem into steps
- Reason about approach
- Take actions (read data, analyze)
- Make decisions (what counts as "risk")
- Evaluate results
- Adjust if needed
- Deliver final report

All autonomously. No waiting for your input between steps.

### Success Indicator:
✅ Claude completed complex analysis independently and delivered actionable report

## 🎓 Progressive Mastery

### Foundation Level (5 minutes)
*Simple agents with clear decision trees*

## Exercise 1: Autonomous Agent Design Templates

This exercise provides four templates, each designed for a different level of complexity and use case, allowing you to master the core principles of agentic prompt engineering.

### What You're Learning (5 Key Principles)
✅ **The Autonomy Principle:** How to delegate decision-making authority to the model, moving from simple instruction-following to true autonomous problem-solving.
✅ **The Workflow Decomposition:** The skill of breaking down a complex, multi-step business process into a clear, sequential, and logical workflow for the agent to follow.
✅ **The Constraint-Based Guardrail:** Using explicit constraints (time, budget, authority) within the prompt to define the agent's boundaries and ensure safe, responsible operation.
✅ **The Iterative Reasoning Loop:** How to structure a prompt that encourages the agent to evaluate its own output, adjust its approach, and self-correct until the goal is met.
✅ **The Tool-Use Integration:** The fundamental concept of an agent reasoning about *when* and *how* to use external tools (like a database query or an API call) to complete its mission.

### Try It Now (7 Steps to Agentic Mastery)

1. **Select Your Template:** Choose one of the four templates above that best matches a real-world problem you want to solve (e.g., Triage Agent for email filtering).
2. **Define Your Mission:** Clearly state the agent's role and the single, measurable goal it must achieve (e.g., "Route 10 emails with 90% accuracy").
3. **Set the Constraints:** Define the agent's boundaries. What data can it use? What actions can it *not* take? (e.g., "Do not reply to the customer," "Only use data from the last 7 days").
4. **Detail the Workflow:** Write out the **5-7 sequential steps** the agent must follow to move from input to final output. This is the core of the agent's logic.
5. **Inject Real Numbers:** Replace the bracketed placeholders in the **Practice Scenario** with real data points (e.g., "Process 15 support tickets," "Score must be above 7.5").
6. **Execute the Prompt:** Copy your fully customized prompt into Claude and initiate the task.
7. **Evaluate and Refine:** Review the agent's output against the **Success Metrics**. If it fails, refine the **Workflow** or **Constraints** and try again.

### Final Success Metric

**Did the agent complete a multi-step task autonomously, making a complex decision that would have previously required human intervention, and deliver a final, actionable result that met all defined constraints?**


### Intermediate Level (7 minutes)
*Complex agents with conditional logic and optimization*

**Exercise 2: Multi-Step Decision Agent**

**Scenario:** Lead scoring and routing agent. Reviews leads, scores them, determines best approach, executes strategy.

**Complex Agent Workflow:**

```
"You are AI sales operations agent.

YOUR MISSION:
Analyze new leads, score them, and route to appropriate sales rep.

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
Review each lead on:
1. COMPANY FIT:
   - Company size vs. our ICP (ideal customer profile)
   - Industry match
   - Technical requirements alignment

2. ENGAGEMENT LEVEL:
   - How they found us (organic / referral / ads)
   - Website activity (pages visited, time spent)
   - Content downloads
   - Demo request or just inquiry?

3. FINANCIAL CAPACITY:
   - Inferred budget (based on company size)
   - B2B or B2C
   - Likely buying timeline

4. LIKELIHOOD TO CONVERT:
   - Does company profile match past customers who converted?
   - How engaged are they (inquiry only vs. demo request)?
   - Decision-maker engagement?

SCORING:
Assign score 1-10 (10=hot lead, 1=unlikely to convert)
Consider: Fit (40%) + Engagement (30%) + Financial (20%) + Pattern match (10%)

ROUTING DECISION:
Score 8-10: Route to: Senior AE (experienced with big deals)
Score 6-7: Route to: Mid-tier AE (growing accounts)
Score 4-5: Route to: Business Development (nurture longer)
Score 1-3: Route to: Drip campaign automation (low-touch nurture)

ACTION FOR EACH LEAD:
- Create CRM record
- Set score and routing
- Draft first outreach email (if routing to sales)
- Schedule follow-up touchpoint

LEADS TO SCORE (list leads with basic info):
[Paste lead list]

Score each lead and execute routing for all."
```

**Agent Makes Continuous Decisions:**

```
For Lead 1:
- Reviews company (200 employees, SaaS)
- Checks: Matches our ICP ✓
- Checks: Engineering-focused (our sweet spot) ✓
- Checks: Website activity (High engagement, 40 min session)
- Checks: Downloaded pricing guide (strong signal)
- Decision: Score 8/10 → Route to Senior AE
- Action: Create record, draft personalized email, schedule intro call

For Lead 2:
- Reviews company (50 employees, startup)
- Checks: Doesn't match ICP (too small)
- Checks: Website activity (Low engagement, 5 min)
- Checks: Just inquiry, no clear need
- Decision: Score 3/10 → Route to automation
- Action: Add to drip campaign, set 2-week follow-up

And so on for each lead...
Agent makes all decisions, takes all actions.
```

- Revenue trends (week-over-week, month-over-month)
- Customer acquisition cost
- Churn rate
- Support ticket volume and SLA compliance
- Sales conversion rates
- Website traffic and conversion
- Team productivity metrics

For each metric:
- Calculate trends
- Identify anomalies (unusual up/down)
- Assess impact (critical / important / minor)

STEP 2: IDENTIFY PROBLEMS
Look for:
- Metrics trending wrong direction
- SLA violations
- Unusual spikes or drops
- Performance below targets
- Opportunities being missed

STEP 3: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
For each problem:
- What's causing this?
- When did it start?
- How many people/customers affected?
- What's the financial impact?

STEP 4: PROPOSE SOLUTIONS
For each identified problem:
- Solution 1: [Quick fix option]
- Solution 2: [Comprehensive solution]
- Solution 3: [Long-term solution]

For each solution:

Analyze, identify problems, propose improvements."
```

**Agent Learning Process:**

```
Week 1:
- Agent analyzes metrics, finds churn spike
- Proposes: Improve support response time
- Implemented: Target response time from 4h to 1h
- Result: Churn stabilized

Week 2:
- Agent notes: Support response improvement worked
- Analyzes: What else correlates with churn?
- Proposes: Customer success outreach for at-risk accounts
- Result: Catches 3 accounts before they churned

Week 3:
- Agent applies learnings: Proactive approach works
- Analyzes: Which accounts are at-risk NOW?
- Proposes: Personalized outreach before problem occurs
- Result: Prevents expected churn

Agent improves over time based on what works.
Self-learning without explicit programming.
