# Lesson 4: ChatGPT Data Analysis - Turn Data into Actionable Business Insights
*Master GPT-5's data analysis capabilities to extract insights, create visualizations, and make data-driven decisions in minutes*

## 💰 The Business Reality

Business data is everywhere, but extracting insights is painfully slow and requires specialized skills:
- **Analysis bottleneck**: Only 12% of employees have data analysis skills, creating 2-3 week backlogs for simple reporting requests that could be done in hours
- **Tool complexity**: Traditional BI tools (Tableau, Power BI) require 40+ hours of training, limiting data access to analysts and preventing self-service insights
- **Decision delays**: Leadership waits 5-7 days for analysis to inform decisions, missing market opportunities and reacting slowly to problems

GPT-5's Advanced Data Analysis (formerly Code Interpreter) enables non-technical users to analyze datasets, create visualizations, and extract insights through natural language—democratizing data access.

**Today's ROI:**
- Time saved: 10-15 hours/week on data analysis and reporting
- Money saved: $3,000+/month vs. hiring data analysts for routine work
- Capability gained: Self-service analytics for entire team, not just technical staff

You need to combine them to answer: "Which marketing channels drive the highest-value customers, and what's the ROI by channel?" This normally requires SQL skills or advanced Excel.

**Your Mission:** Integrate multiple datasets and build business models using GPT-5.

**Multi-Dataset Integration Prompt:**

```
I have 3 datasets that need to be combined and analyzed:

DATASET 1: sales_transactions.csv
Columns: transaction_id, customer_id, date, amount, product_category

DATASET 2: customer_demographics.csv
Columns: customer_id, age_group, location, signup_date, acquisition_channel

DATASET 3: marketing_spend.csv
Columns: month, channel, spend_amount

ANALYSIS GOAL:
Calculate marketing ROI by channel, considering customer lifetime value

STEP 1: DATA INTEGRATION
- Join sales with customers on customer_id
- Aggregate marketing spend by channel and month
- Create master dataset with all relevant fields

STEP 2: CALCULATE METRICS
For each acquisition channel:
- Total customers acquired
- Average first purchase amount
- Average customer lifetime value (sum of all purchases)
- Customer retention rate (purchased >1 time)
- Total revenue generated

For marketing ROI:
- Cost per acquisition (CPA): spend / customers acquired
- Revenue per acquisition (RPA): total revenue / customers acquired  
- ROI: (RPA - CPA) / CPA × 100
- Payback period: CPA / (monthly revenue per customer)

STEP 3: SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS
Which channels bring the highest value customers?
- LTV by channel
- Repeat purchase rate by channel
- Product mix by channel (do different channels prefer different products?)

STEP 4: RECOMMENDATIONS
- Which channels should we increase spend on?
- Which channels should we reduce?
- What's optimal budget allocation across channels?
- Expected ROI improvement from reallocation

STEP 5: VISUALIZATIONS
- Chart 1: ROI by channel (bar chart, sorted)
- Chart 2: CPA vs LTV scatter plot (each dot = channel)
- Chart 3: Revenue contribution by channel over time (area chart)

OUTPUT: Executive dashboard with clear investment recommendations
```

**Complex Analysis Patterns:**

**Cohort Analysis:**
```
I have user signup data with dates and subsequent activity.

Create cohort analysis:
- Group users by signup month (cohorts)
- Track retention rate: % still active after 1, 3, 6, 12 months
- Calculate revenue per cohort over time
- Identify which cohorts have best/worst retention
- Create cohort retention heatmap

Question: Is retention improving for recent cohorts vs. older ones?
```

**Funnel Analysis:**
```
I have data on user journey steps:
- Step 1: Homepage visit
- Step 2: Product page view
- Step 3: Add to cart
- Step 4: Checkout started
- Step 5: Purchase completed

Calculate:
- Conversion rate at each step
- Drop-off points: Where are we losing most users?
- Segment by traffic source: Which sources have best conversion?
- Time analysis: How long between steps on average?

Visualize as funnel chart with conversion rates.
```

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
```
I have a business model with these assumptions:
- Customer acquisition cost: $50
- Average purchase: $100
- Repeat purchase rate: 30%
- Monthly churn: 5%

Build sensitivity analysis:
- If CAC increases 20%, what happens to unit economics?
- If repeat rate improves to 40%, what's the impact?
- What combination of factors gets us to profitability?

Create scenario table showing outcomes under different assumptions.
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting & Pro Tips

### Common Issues

**Problem 1: "GPT-5 can't handle my large dataset (500K+ rows)"**  
**Solution:** Sample your data first: "Randomly sample 10,000 rows for analysis" or aggregate: "Group by month before analysis." For very large datasets, use database tools.

**Problem 2: "Visualizations look unprofessional"**  
**Solution:** Be specific: "Use [company colors], format Y-axis as currency, add data labels, remove grid lines, use font size 12." Treat GPT-5 like a designer—give exact specs.

**Problem 3: "Analysis seems wrong or doesn't make sense"**  
**Solution:** Always validate key findings manually. Ask GPT-5: "Show me the top 10 rows of data after transformation" to verify logic. AI can make calculation errors.

**Problem 4: "I don't know what questions to ask"**  
**Solution:** Start with: "Analyze this data and suggest 5 interesting questions I should ask." Then drill into the most relevant ones.

### Pro Tips

**💡 Technique 1: "Progressive Refinement"**  
Start broad ("summarize this data"), then iterate ("dig deeper into that trend," "break down by segment"). Build analysis layer by layer.

**💡 Technique 2: "Always Export Raw Data"**  
Ask: "Export the cleaned data and calculations as CSV" so you have audit trail and can validate in Excel if needed.

**💡 Technique 3: "Explain Your Analysis"**  
Request: "Explain your methodology and assumptions." This catches errors and helps you learn analytical techniques.

**💡 Technique 4: "Cross-Check Critical Numbers"**  
For business-critical analysis, validate totals and key metrics manually. Don't blindly trust AI calculations.

**💡 Technique 5: "Save Your Prompts"**  
Build library of analysis prompts that work well. Reuse and refine them for similar future analyses.
