4. **Time Constraints:** 45-60 min with immediate value beats longer, theory-heavy lessons
5. **Team Adoption:** Business integration section helps clients roll out to teams (more revenue)

### What Structure A Does Better:

**Batch Generation Workflow** ⭐

## 💼 BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION

**Why This Matters for Alt/Shift:**

Your clients are paying for **business transformation**, not education credits.

Structure A says: *"Here's comprehensive knowledge"*
Structure B says: *"Here's $5K/month in savings, starting now"*

**Which pitch wins B2B sales?** Structure B.

**But:** Use Structure A's *production methodology* to build Structure B's *business-focused content* faster and better.
